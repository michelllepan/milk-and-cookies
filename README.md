## milk & cookies

milk & cookies is a Chrome extension that extracts replaceable ingredients from a recipe, and automatically suggests alternatives. Users can choose which ingredients they would like to replace and select an alternative that fits their needs. The extension updates the recipe on the website to display the replacements and their corresponding measurements in order to successfully meet the user's needs.

Faced with the challenge of finding recipes that meet our dietary needs, we've built milk & cookies with the goal of personalizing the baking experience to make it more accessible for all.
